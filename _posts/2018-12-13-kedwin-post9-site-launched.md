<h1> Flag Project - In Progress Reflection </h1>

![My Flag](/images/flag.png)

This is how my flag looks after working on it from the first time. We started making our flags on constructions paper to plan out how we wanted our flags to look. It personally helped me because I was able to figure out the right dimensions of my flag and transfer it onto pyret. I also need to do is use bitmap/url and add the Coat of Arms. Now we need to make it so that we can change the width and height of the flag with only two numbers. Next week we're going to keep working on this and we may be able to finish it.
