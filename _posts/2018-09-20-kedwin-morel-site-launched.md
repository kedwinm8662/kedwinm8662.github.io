Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. When I first started with this I was completely lost until I got help from people around me. Slowly I started to understand what I had to do. A challenge that I had was making a directory, but now that I know how it's actually way more simple than I thought it was. As I progressed with making this website it was getting easier. The next and last challenge I had was getting this blog to work. I just kept on changing stuff and looking back at what I did until I finally got it right. Now I'm fianlly finished with my first reflection and making this blog.
