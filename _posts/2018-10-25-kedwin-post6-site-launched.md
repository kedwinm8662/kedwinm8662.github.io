This week we learned about data programming. We learned how to create a data table and add new things to it. On Monday we added different shapes to the table and the amount of corners it had. We then had to add another column called is-round and say if it was true or false. I had no challenges when it came to this because I looked at what the function was supposed to do and the do now told us what was supposed to be done so I just added more information to the data table.
