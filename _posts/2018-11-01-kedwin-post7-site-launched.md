This week in AP CS we connected contracts. We improved our data charts and worked with booleans. I didn't have any problems while doing this. We worked on making contracts and giving them their own functions. We had to work on 15 problems and make a contract for each of them. I had a problem with this because I didn't know how the contract should start. When I finally started it I was able to do the next few but the problems got harder and I wasn't able to finish it.
