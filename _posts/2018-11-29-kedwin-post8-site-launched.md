<h1> Midterm Analysis - Question 25 </h1>
  On the AP Computer Science Midterm question 25 had the lowest average of students getting it correct. In the question we had to choose the best contract that matches the example. This question was for MS3 and the most we could have gotten from this question was a practitioner. The correct answer was a and most people didn't choose it. To me this question was confusing because it seems like a string and a number is used but only and image and a number is used. I thought it would have produces an image but it produces a number. Every other answer choice excpet for a was incorrect. We most likely got it incorrect because is seems as if the contract is going to produce an image.
