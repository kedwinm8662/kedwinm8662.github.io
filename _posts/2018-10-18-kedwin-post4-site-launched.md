![My Flag](/images/flag.png)
This week in AP CS we continued making our flags but this time we started coding it. We practiced our pair programming skills by working with someone else to create different types of functions. Then we continued to work on our flags aga0in. A challenge I had was getting more than one shape onto another shape. The problem was that I was using overlay instead of using place-image. I made it easier to go by making definitions of the shapes I needed to use.
