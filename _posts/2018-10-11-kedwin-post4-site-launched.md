This week we focused on making our flags on pyret. First we had to make our flags on a piece of paper and use construction paper to design it. We then had to go on computers and start coding to make our flag. I did good on making the shapes but one challenge I had was overlaying them. I had to look through pyret and do research to figure out how to solve this. I still haven't found the solution but I'm going to keep on looking to solve this problem. Next week we're going to continue working on this and finish our flags with color on them.
